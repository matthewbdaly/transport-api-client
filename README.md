# api-client-boilerplate

Boilerplate for writing PHP API clients. Uses PHPSpec and HTTPlug.

How do I use it?
----------------

```bash
composer create-project matthewbdaly/api-client-boilerplate <YOUR_NEW_LIBRARY_DIRECTORY>
```

This will generate a starting boilerplate for your API client. You'll want to update your `composer.json` and `phpspec.yml` with your required namespace and other details.
